# How is the CLI working

You might have noticed a CLI is provided. It can be run with the following
command:

```console
$ ./docker/bin/cli
$ # or if you don't use Docker
$ ./cli
```

By default, it shows you how to use the command. The syntax mimics a browser
requests: it takes a `--request` parameter which is used to create a `Request`
object as seen in the previous section. Parameters can be passed with the
following syntax: `-pKEY=VALUE` where KEY is the parameter name and VALUE its
value.

The architecture of the [`cli` file](/cli) is, in fact, pretty similar to the
[`public/index.php`](/public/index.php). It just needs to create the Request
object differently, and the `Application` class can be found in the
[`src/cli/Application.php` file](/src/cli/Application.php). The routers are
different to avoid exposing the CLI routes to the browser. They should be
inaccessible either way since they use the `cli` via method instead of `get` or
`post`: itâ€™s only an additional security.

The CLI controllers work the same way as the other controllers, but they
usually return text instead of HTML since it would be unreadable in a console.

Finally, the CLI exit code is 0 if the response HTTP code is 20x, and 1
otherwise.
