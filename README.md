    <strong>A citizen social media to soothe our online relationship with the news.</strong>
</p>

---

Flusio is another yet social media. It brings together social bookmarking and
Web syndication to allow communities to stay up to date with the news and to
enhance their knowledge.

It’s [free/libre software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)
(politically speaking) while being supported by a micro-enterprise to ensure
its viability. The main service will be available to French people at
[flus.fr](https://flus.fr).

For now, the software doesn’t exist yet.
