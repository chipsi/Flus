    <strong>A citizen social media to soothe our online relationship with the news.</strong>
</p>

---

flusio is another yet social media. It brings together social bookmarking and
Web syndication to allow communities to stay up to date with the news and to
enhance their knowledge.

It’s [free/libre software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)
(politically speaking) while being supported by a micro-enterprise to ensure
its viability. The main service will be available to French people at
[flus.fr](https://flus.fr).

If you want to help to fund the development, you can either take a subscription
to [Flus 1](https://rss.flus.fr) or contribute to [a common pot](https://flus.fr/cagnotte).
These methods are intended for French people. You can [learn more here](https://flus.fr/financement).

**The rest of the documentation is intended to potential developers.**

## How to contribute?

There’s no process to contribute yet, but feel free to [send me a message](https://flus.fr/contact).

If you open a pull request anyway, please fill the pull request message
properly. It’s intented to remind you (and me!) important things to check when
code is changed. You’ll have to wait for the CI to run over your code then. If
everything is fine, the status should tell you the checks are successful and
the pull request can be merged.
